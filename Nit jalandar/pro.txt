Problem

Michal Scofield and Lincon burrow are two brothers. By a murder allegation Lincon Burrow was sentenced to jail. Michal Scofield some how came to know that his brother is not guilty and he don’t have time to file case against the allegations as his brother is going to sit on death chair soon enough. So he made a plan for Prison break before handing himself over to police in a robbery allegation he made tattoos on his whole body a way of encrypting messages. He decided secretly on the number of columns and write the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so as to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is “There’s no place like home on a snowy night” and there are five columns, Michal would write down

t o i o y
h p k n n
e l e a i
r a h s g
e c o n h
s e m o t
n l e w x

Note that Michal Scofield includes only letters in between the tattoos and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Michael used the character ‘x’ to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter. Michael then tattooed them by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted as

toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx

At the time of the break he forget something about encryption .Your job is to recover for Michal the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the encrypted one.
Input

The first line have a integer T number of test cases. Input for each test case will consist of two lines. The first line will contain an integer c indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up to 200 lower case letters.
Output

Each input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.

CodeChef - A Platform for Aspiring Programmers

CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming and programming contests. At CodeChef we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month. We also aim to have training sessions and discussions related to algorithms, binary search, technicalities like array size and the likes. Apart from providing a platform for programming competitions, CodeChef also has various algorithm tutorials and forum discussions to help those who are new to the world of computer programming.

Practice Section - A Place to hone your 'Computer Programming Skills'

Try your hand at one of our many practice problems and submit your solution in a language of your choice. Our programming contest judge accepts solutions in over 35+ programming languages. Preparing for coding contests were never this much fun! Receive points, and move up through the CodeChef ranks. Use our practice section to better prepare yourself for the multiple programming challenges that take place through-out the month on CodeChef.

Compete - Monthly Programming Contests and Cook-offs

Here is where you can show off your computer programming skills. Take part in our 10 day long monthly coding contest and the shorter format Cook-off coding contest. Put yourself up for recognition and win great prizes. Our programming contests have prizes worth up to Rs.20,000 and $700lots more CodeChef goodies up for grabs.

Discuss

Are you new to computer programming? Do you need help with algorithms? Then be a part of CodeChef's Forums and interact with all our programmers - they love helping out other programmers and sharing their ideas. Have discussions around binary search, array size, branch-and-bound, Dijkstra's algorithm, Encryption algorithm and more by visiting the CodeChef Forums and Wiki section.

CodeChef Community

As part of our Educational initiative, we give institutes the opportunity to associate with CodeChef in the form of Campus Chapters. Hosting online programming competitions is not the only feature on CodeChef. You can also host a coding contest for your institute on CodeChef, organize an algorithm event and be a guest author on our blog.

Go For Gold

The Go for Gold Initiative was launched about a year after CodeChef was incepted, to help prepare Indian students for the ACM ICPC World Finals competition. In the run up to the ACM ICPC competition, the Go for Gold initiative uses CodeChef as a platform to train students for the ACM ICPC competition via multiple warm up contests. As an added incentive the Go for Gold initiative is also offering over Rs.8 lacs to the Indian team that beats the 29th position at the ACM ICPC world finals. Find out more about the Go for Gold and the ACM ICPC competition here.

Electricity Cutoff

Problem code: DS5

Background

During the Electricity cutoff in United States this winter (caused by low leves of the hydro dams), a scheme was developed to turn off the Electricity to areas of the country in a particular sequence, totally fair, manner. The country was divided into N regions (LA was region number 1, and NYC number 13). A number ,k, would be picked `at random', and the Electricity would first be turned off in region 1 (clearly the fair at starting point) and then in every k'th region after that, wrapping around to 1 after N, and ignoring regions already turned off.
The problem is that it is perfectly fair to turn off electricity of NYC in last (because, the Electricity headquarters are situated there), so for a given N, the `random' number k needs to be carefully chosen so that region 13 is the last region selected.
Write a code that will take a input number of regions and then find out the smallest number k that will ensure that NYC (region 13) can have electricity while the rest of the country is in electricity cutoff.
Input

In each line input consists of a integer N (greater than or equal to 13) and input will be terminated by a line containing 0.
Output

Output may have a single line or a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each line will consist of the number k according to the above scheme.
Constraints

Number of regions (13<=N<=100)
Sample Input

17

18

0

Sample Output

7

17

Asked too soon. Don't bother. Found it.
phantom11 @ 11 Feb 2013 04:48 PM
How can there be a solution to n=14!!!
evilnesa @ 11 Feb 2013 04:51 PM
Don't ask so soon try to find it.. there is a answer ..
chandan11111 @ 11 Feb 2013 05:29 PM
@phantom11 the answer for n=14 exit :) think when k>n ;)
nitheesh1993 @ 11 Feb 2013 06:00 PM
should there be a line gap b/w the outputs?
aastha1kapoor @ 11 Feb 2013 06:37 PM
please explain d question...nt clear..
goelrinku @ 11 Feb 2013 06:40 PM

ayushrocker92 @ 11 Feb 2013 07:25 PM
not clear
sahil09 @ 11 Feb 2013 07:37 PM
can any1 explain the sample test cases please
akash2504 @ 11 Feb 2013 07:42 PM
plz xplain the sample test case ?? how 7 for 17
aayushagarwal @ 11 Feb 2013 07:48 PM
what's the answer for 12 and 21???
swapnilsm @ 11 Feb 2013 08:14 PM
How the output is 7 for 17 regions ? The sequence will be : 1 8 15 5 12 2 9 16 6 13 But this doesn't cover regions like 3 4 and many more....
aayushagarwal @ 11 Feb 2013 09:09 PM
how can there be answer for 12???....its already mentioned that input>=13
rohit38sharma @ 11 Feb 2013 09:35 PM
how many lines in b/w the outputs..?
bugkiller @ 11 Feb 2013 10:57 PM
What to print when no such k is possible for that N?
bugkiller @ 11 Feb 2013 10:58 PM
What to print when no such k is possible for that N? like when N = 14, 21 etc. then no such K is possible, what to print then?
bugkiller @ 11 Feb 2013 11:17 PM
@dhiraj74 >> thanks. never thought of k > n
abhinav92003 @ 11 Feb 2013 11:34 PM
@admin please make sure that the test cases pass the input constraints
stalin @ 11 Feb 2013 11:55 PM
Please clarify how the answer is k=7 for n=17? After electricity is tunred off in region 1, is next region=8 (k=7)? The regions where electricity has already been turned off are to be counted or not?
stalin @ 12 Feb 2013 12:00 AM
Please clarify how the answer is k=7 for n=17? After electricity is tunred off in region 1, is next region=8 (k=7)? The regions where electricity has already been turned off are to be counted or not? As 'swapnilsm' commented above, in this case the sequence of turning off electricity will be will be : 1 8 15 5 12 2 9 16 6 13! 13 is turned off with other regions still turned on! So please expalin!!!
opengeest @ 12 Feb 2013 01:00 AM

vivek07672 @ 12 Feb 2013 02:55 AM
specify constraint on k and correct output format .....I have checked for so many test cases ...and I am getting right result ...but unable to submit to get answer correct .....:(
sudhatks @ 12 Feb 2013 05:22 AM
same case... wrong answer!! what's the output format?
babl00 @ 12 Feb 2013 05:50 AM
